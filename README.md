# flutter_home_widget

Mobile app version of [AIUB Course Info](https://aiub.brainbird.org) ( [git repo](https://github.com/itsfuad/AIUB_Course_Info)). I am fetching data from it's creator's [backend](https://github.com/itsfuad/AIUB_Solution_ProxyServer) and showing it in my flutter app.

Hopefully will create a widget for class routine.
